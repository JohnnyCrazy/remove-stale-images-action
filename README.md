# Remove Stale Images

> âš  This action is only compatible with the deprecated `docker.pkg.github.com` registry. The new registry `ghcr.io` does not yet have a specific API (only docker v2 AFAIK) and does not trigger `registry_package`, so it can't be used with this action.

Small action which keeps your image count at a fixed number, removing all old ones. This allows for some space saving if you don't depend on old image tags.

# Example Usage

```yaml
name: 'stale-remover'
on: [registry_package]

jobs:
  removeStaleImages: # make sure the action works on a clean machine without building
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: johnnycrazy/remove-stale-images-action@v1
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          packages: odin # comma seperated list of your projects/image names
          keep: 5 # Keep the latest 5 tags
```
